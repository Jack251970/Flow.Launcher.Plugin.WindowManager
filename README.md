## üìù Usage

### 0. Set Action Keyword

The default action keyword is `wm`, you can change it in the Flow Launcher.

### 1. Config Administrator Mode (Optional)

This plugin requires administrator privileges to:

* Move and resize elevated windows

For full functionality, we recommend running Flow Launcher as administrator during automatic launches:

* Exit Flow Launcher
* Run Flow Launcher as administrator
* Open setting window and navigate to `General` page
* Enable `Use logon task instead of task entry for faster startup experience`
* Disable `Start Flow Launcher on system startup`
* Enable `Start Flow Launcher on system startup`

Then we can verify if it succeeded:

* Open `Task Scheduler`
* Find the logon task with name `Flow.Launcher Startup`
* Check if `Security options` -> `Run with highest privileges` is on

> [!WARNING]
> Running as administrator may launch other applications with elevated privileges without UAC prompts.
> So please use this with caution.

### 2. Uninstall Programs

Use the action keyword to search for commands in Flow Launcher and click any result to execute it.
